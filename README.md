A new language model was created using Python, q-grams, and hash tables as its core data structure. It was trained and tested on Wikitext2 and PTB datasets, achieving a lower perplexity value of 6.2 for Wikitext2 and 28 for PTB, indicating improved performance after adjustments. While it falls short of state-of-the-art models, it's worth noting that it was developed from scratch without relying on pre-existing solutions.
